# R-hex
Negotiating difficult terrains has always been a challenging task for wheeled robots. To solve this issue, man has been trying to design various legged robots, taking inspiration from nature. Out of all these legged robots, six legged robots are the most common ones, since 6 legs have an edge over other legged robots considering their stability. In hexapods, generally a tripod gait is in used in which 2 sets of legs(3 each ) are alternatively on the ground. This hexapod is our attempt to tackle the same issue of all terrain driving capabilities. Instead of normal legs we have used C-shaped legs which have an added advantage of climbing obstacles, pretty taller than itself.
